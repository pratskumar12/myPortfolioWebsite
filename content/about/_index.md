This is my about page. :wave:

I am 26 years old and I am on a journey of self-discovery to figure out how I would like to live my life. I believe that my purpose of life should be to do work that can positively impact the lives of people who are facing problems that are causing them to suffer. If I can , through my work, bring some happiness in their lives by reduicng their pain points , then I will be satisfied and hapy at the end of the day.

I have product development experience and now I want to take ownership of the entire product development lifecycle. My strongest skill is my sense of emapthy and this I belive  makes me  best suited to deliver the best results for the end users.
