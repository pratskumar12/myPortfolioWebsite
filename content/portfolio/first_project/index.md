Below I describe the work put in as part of developing a fundraising strategy for our client - Activate Action. The project was part of my engagement with Impact Consulting- a platfrom , offering pro bono consulting services to NGOs and Social enterprises.

## How We Created User Personas for Our Crowdfunding Campaign

### Who was the client?
Activate Action is a youth-led community-based organization working with young people living with HIV and disabilities aged 14 to 24 years in Homa-Bay, Kenya.  The organization started as a youth friendly sexual and reproductive health center in 2017 and later registered as a community-based organization with the Ministry of Social Services (registration number CBO/HUD/HB/0098/2020) in 2020.

The team consists of young people aged 18 to 34 years old including high school and university students, young professionals, people living with HIV and disability, and other marginalized people, including teenage mothers. They partner with governments, the private sector, local/international organizations, and civil society to bring about positive social change and to provide lifesaving health care, quality education, and opportunities that foster meaningful involvement of young people in sexual reproductive health and community development.

**Mission:** To build an inclusive social environment for young people living with HIV and disability in Homabay Kenya.

### Why did we decide to start a crowdfunding campaign to raise funds?
 NGOs often rely on donations and grants to fund their activities and projects. However, raising funds can be challenging and time-consuming for NGOs, especially in a competitive and uncertain environment. That’s why many NGOs are turning to crowdfunding as an alternative or complementary way of financing their missions. Crowdfunding is the practice of collecting small amounts of money from numerous people, typically via online platforms. Thea advantages are :
 1. Crowdfunding can help NGOs reach a wider and more diverse audience of potential donors who share their vision and passion for their cause
 2. Crowdfunding can help NGOs raise funds more efficiently and effectively than traditional fundraising methods, such as applying for grants or seeking out individual donors
 3. Crowdfunding can help NGOs refine their ideas and improve their products or services by getting feedback and suggestions from their backers

 ### What are user personas  and why  are they important for targeted decision-making
 User personas are fictional characters that represent the different types of users who might use your product or service. They are based on real data and research about your target audience’s goals, pain points, behavior, and demographic information. User personas help you understand and empathize with your end-users and make design decisions that suit their needs and expectations. They also help you build traction, social proof, and validation for your product or service and refine your ideas and improve your product or service by getting feedback and suggestions from your users.
