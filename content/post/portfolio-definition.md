Product management is the process of creating, launching and managing products that solve customer problems and deliver value. Product managers are responsible for understanding customer needs, defining product vision and strategy, collaborating with cross-functional teams, testing and iterating on solutions, and measuring and communicating results.

Product management can be applied to any industry or domain, but I believe that it has a special role to play in the social sector. Product management can help create products that address some of the most pressing challenges in the world, such as poverty, health, education, environment, etc.

According to the World Bank, more than 700 million people live in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 a day) globally. Poverty is not only a lack of income, but also a lack of access to basic services such as health care, education, water, sanitation, and electricity. Product management can help design products that are accessible, affordable, inclusive and culturally appropriate for low-income users.

According to the World Health Organization, more than half of the worldâ€™s population lacks access to essential health services. Health is not only a physical condition, but also a social determinant of well-being and quality of life. Product management can help design products that improve health outcomes and reduce health disparities for underserved populations. For example, one of the products that I admire is CareMessage, a platform that enables health care organizations to communicate with low-income patients via text messages. The platform helps patients manage their chronic conditions, adhere to their treatment plans and access preventive care and social services.

According to the United Nations, more than 250 million children are out of school globally. Education is not only a human right, but also a key driver of economic and social development. Product management can help design products that enhance learning outcomes and opportunities for marginalized students. For example, one of the products that I find inspiring is Duolingo, a language-learning app that uses gamification and personalization to make learning fun and effective. The app helps millions of people learn new languages for free, and also provides access to education for refugees and immigrants.

These are just some examples of how product management can make a positive social impact in different domains. There are many more products and programs that aim to make a difference in the world. Product management can also help foster innovation and collaboration among different stakeholders in the social sector. Product management can help bring together different perspectives and expertise from NGOs, governments, donors, researchers, users and other partners. Product management can help create a shared vision and strategy, align incentives and expectations, leverage resources and capabilities, and deliver value for all parties involved.

In conclusion, product management and social impact are two fields that can complement and enhance each other. Product management can help create products that are not only profitable, but also beneficial for communities and society. Social impact can help create products that are not only innovative, but also impactful. As an aspiring product manager who wants to work in the social impact space, I am excited to explore the possibilities and opportunities that this combination offers. I hope that this blog post has inspired you to think about how you can use product management to make a positive difference in the world.
